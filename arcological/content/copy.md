    Arcological Association works as a decentralized Swiss based funding vehicle
    for common/public good funders, providing efficient legal, financial and
    operational infrastructure. Operational support enables high impact/highly
    optimized allocation of funding to accelerate public goods projects. Trust
    is key. We can turn researchers, developers, artists and founders into
    advocates by relationship-building, leveraging social graphs and expanding
    our community outside of the current feedback loops.

      Arcological builds relationships with aligned partners (e.g. web3
      foundations and organizations like gitcoin, eth foundation, dot) to expand
      the impact of our public goods efforts. AA is focusing on scaling
      communities by scaling the public goods which they thrive on, educating
      and empowering them via transparency to make their best work using our
      partner's technology.

    The IPFS Implementations Fund is driving the transformation of IPFS from
    reliance on a primary implementation to many implementations in order to
    meet the needs of a diverse environment of creators, developers and
    audiences utilizing IPFS beyond the current use cases. This fund will
    catalyze and accelerate the development of new IPFS implementations to serve
    new adoption channels, and ensure continuity for high impact teams working
    on current IPFS implementations to build and grow.

    The Private Retrieval Fund seeks to explore and develop viable mechanisms
    for reader-private communications (for application on libp2p, IPFS and
    beyond): we intend to fund both research leading to deployment-ready design
    sketches for private communication mechanisms as well as development
    activities implementing systems prototypes.

    The Arcological Association (AA) supports the regenerative growth of
    research, development and projects creating public goods in web3. We are
    building out the public good by creating the operational and financial
    infrastructure to massively accelerate promising new models of research,
    development and infrastructure. Arcological’s near-term focus is creating a
    new model for funding early and mid-stage web3 commons.

  title: About
  content: >
    The overall goal of AA is to help projects/teams/ideas working on public
    goods and common problems really take off. Some haven’t even started working
    yet, and others have been in development for a year(s).  At whatever stage,
    AA's goal is to accelerate projects/teams by providing operational,
    financial expertise and developing collaboratively new models for funding
    untraditional ROI models.
